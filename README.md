# Just Tri It

![Am I Responsive]()

Just Tri It is an online marketplace where users can sign up as ‘athletes’ to purchase triathlon gear. Admin pending, users can also become ‘sellers’ allowing them to list their used triathlon gear.

# User Stories

There are three types of user on the site: 
A user who would register to view and purchase listings only.
A user with seller status who can do the above as well as add their own listings for others to purchase as well as edit and delete their own listings.
Finally, a superuser who can update a user’s seller status, add listings and edit or delete any listing listed on the site.

- As a user, I want to be able to add various listings to my basket before completing a purchase via a check out.
- As a user, I want to be able to filter listings by the three main triathlon disciplines of Swim, Bike and Run.
- As a user, I want to be able to filter listings by their condition such as New, Excellent, Good or Used.
- As a user, I want to be able to see an overall summary of all listings available to purchase.
- As a user, I want to be able to click on an individual listing to see more information regarding the listing.
- As a user, I want to be able to vary the quantity of a listing I can input into the basket when viewing the listing.
- As a user, I want to be able to update the quantity and/or remove a listing from my basket.
- As a user, I want to be able to create an account/profile.
- As a user, I want to be able to save default information in my account profile.
- As a user, I want to be able to view my previous order history.
- As a user with seller status, in addition to the above, I want to be able to add, edit and delete any listings I have uploaded.
- As a super user, in addition to the above, I want to be able to edit and delete any listing on the site.
- As a super user, in addition to the above, I want to be able to update a registered profile’s seller status.
- As a super user, in addition to the above, I want to be able to add, edit and delete categories and conditions.

# UX

The aim of the site is to be as minimal as possible so that attention is focused on the database content.

The website utilises Materialize CSS to responsively react to different screen sizes so that the user can view content on multiple devices.

## Colour Scheme

The colour scheme below was generated by [coolors](https://coolors.co/).

I selected the colour scheme by selecting a different colour to represent each of the three sports that make up the triathlon discipline on a white background with granite text.

# Features

## Existing Features

### Navbar

The responsive navbar features the site logo on the left-hand whilst the options available on the right-hand side vary depending on user authentication status. The logo is a hyperlink to the site’s home page.
If a visitor to the site is not registered/logged in, the options displayed will be Register, Log In and the shopping basket.
If a user is logged in, does not have seller status and is not a super user, the options displayed will be Athlete Profile, Log Out and the shopping basket.
If a user is logged in, has seller status and is not a super user, the options displayed will be Athlete Profile, Listing Admin, Log Out and the shopping basket.
Finally, if the user is logged in and is a super user, the options displayed will be Profile Admin, Listing Admin, Athlete Profile, Log Out and the shopping basket.
The content of the navbar collapses into a side-nav on medium screen sizes and below where all the above still applies. When the menu collapses to become a side-nav, the logo shifts to the middle of the navbar.

### Promo Banner

The site displays a banner for promotional messages on all pages immediately below the navbar on all screen sizes.

# Testing

To view all testing documentation, please refer to [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

# Stripe Set Up



# AWS Set Up

# Deployment

The live deployed application can be found at [Just-Tri-It](https://just-tri-it.herokuapp.com/).

## Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select *New* in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select *Create new app* from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select *Create App*.

![Heroku App Set-Up](documentation/deployment/atletico-crud-heroku-initial-steps.jpg)

- From the new app *Settings*, click *Reveal Config Vars*, and set the following key/value pairs:
  - `IP` 0.0.0.0
  - `PORT` 5000

  - `DATABASE_URL` (this comes from the _Resources_ tab, you can get your own Postgres Database using the Free Hobby Tier)
    - Click on the _Resources_ tab.
    - Search for Postgres in the 'Add-ons' search bar.
    - Select Heroku Postgres as shown in the screenshot below.

![Heroku Postgres Add-On](documentation/deployment/atletico-crud-heroku-postgres-add-on.png)

  - `SECRET_KEY` (this can be any random secret key)

The below screenshot shows the completed config vars page on Heroku with sensitive information in the value boxes redacted.

![Set Config Vars](documentation/deployment/atletico-crud-heroku-config-vars-update.png)

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's requirements (where applicable) using: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using: `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

![Freeze requirements.txt](documentation/deployment/atletico-crud-heroku-freeze-requirements.png)

The Procfile can be created with the following command: `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`

![Create Procfile](documentation/deployment/atletico-crud-heroku-procfile.png)

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:
- Connect Heroku and GitHub.

![Connect Heroku and GitHub ](documentation/deployment/atletico-crud-heroku-connect-to-github.png)

- Then select "Automatic Deployment" from the Heroku app.

![Enable Auto Deployment](documentation/deployment/atletico-crud-heroku-enable-auto-deploys.png)

- Click the _Deploy Branch_ button.

![App Successfully Deployed](documentation/deployment/atletico-crud-heroku-successfully-deployed-app.png)

Or:
- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a <app_name>` (replace app_name with your app, without the angle-brackets)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type: `git push heroku main`

The frontend terminal should now be connected and deployed to Heroku.

## Local Deployment

*Gitpod* IDE was used to write the code for this project.

To make a local copy of this repository, you can clone the project by typing the follow into your IDE terminal:
- `git clone https://github.com/sniclasj/just-tri-it.git`

You can install this project's requirements (where applicable) using: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

Create an `env.py` file, and add the following environment variables:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "Get from Stripe website")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "Get from Stripe website")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "Get from Stripe website")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "Get from Hobby Tier on the Resources tab from Heroku")
os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", "True if in development, False if not")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "Any random secret key")
```

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

## Difference Between Local and Deployed Versions

Certain images are only deployed on the Heroku app as they are stored in AWS as opposed to the local media file.
